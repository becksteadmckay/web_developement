      A little about the Rater:
      McKay is known as an impartial movie judge with his peers. He is a movie-watching critic with unmatched rating
      skills. He has watched all the movies he has rated. Some say McKay has some bias towards Toby McGuire and
      Christian Bale, however, McKay says that's absurd. He would continue to say that Tobey McGuire and Christian Bale
      are the best spider-man and batman.

    <h3>Super-Hero Movie Rankings</h3>
    <p>
      The Dark Knight Thoughts
      The Dark Knight has a depth that other superhero movies lack. There are times in the movie when it doesn't feel
      like a superhero movie but a real-life situation. It is filled with thought-provoking themes that can get anyone's
      mind turning. One theme this movie has is chaos. The Joker causes chaos in Gotham. Heath Ledger's performance of
      the Joker was remarkable for anyone to watch. The Joker may be one of the most compelling villains in a superhero
      movie. Someone who just wants to watch the world burn.


      Spider-Man 2 Thoughts
      Spider-Man 2 is great. It has my favorite scene out of any superhero movie ever. Spider-Man chases the villain
      Doc-Oc while trying to stop a train. Spider-man heroically sacrifices all his energy and strength to stop the
      train then passes out. The passengers of the train catch him before he falls. The scene becomes iconic when the
      passengers lift Spider-Man above them passing him to the next passenger and so forth down the train. I love this
      movie because of the complex relationship between Mary Jane and Peter Parker. Peter Parker doesn't want to be
      spider-man so he can spend time with Mary Jane. It highlights a real personal conflict in Peter Parker's life.
      Peter Parker eventually sacrifices his personal life to become Spider-Man.

      Thor Ragnarok Thoughts
      Thor Ragnarok made my top three because it's entertaining and funny. Director Taika Waititi decided to take the
      character of Thor in a new direction. Thor had previously had long gold locks in a movie with a serious attitude.
      They also took away Thor's Hammer making him the God of Thunder, not the God of Hammers. I loved the new Thor with
      a little bit of humor. I think everyone likes this Thor more because this movie outperformed the other Thor movies
      at the box office. The reinvented Thor was a blast to watch. Another thing this movie does well is it has an
      unexpected plot. I hate movies that are predictable and follow the same superhero movie archetype. This movie was
      a present surprise. I didn't expect the movie's ending.

      Peter Parker eventually sacrifices his personal life to become Spider-Man.


      Spider-Man: No Way Home Thoughts
      This movie did everything I have ever wanted and didn't disappoint. I love spider-man and would have dreamed to
      see three different spider-man sharing the screen. A couple of my favorite villains the Green Goblin and Doc Oc
      returned. There is a risk of overwhelming the audience with too many heroes and villains. We can look at
      Spider-Man 3 and Spider-Man 2 to learn that lesson. However, this movie balances so many characters perfectly. I
      loved the intercourse between the three Spider-Man which caused a lot of funny scenes.

      Spider-Man 1 Thoughts
      This is number 3 on my list because it is the best origin story of Spider-Man. Sam Raimi makes Peter Parker is a
      very relatable teenager. Peter Parker is shown as a quiet dork who is too shy to ask out Mary Jane. I love Willem
      Dafoe as the Green Goblin. I have realized a lot of the great superhero movies aren't defined by the superhero but
      the villain and this is a great example of that. I loved how there was a conflict in th Green Goblin's character.
